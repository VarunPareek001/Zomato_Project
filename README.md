This Zomato_Project involves several stages of data exploration and analysis:-
1) Data Overview: The notebook begins by loading the required libraries (pandas and numpy) and the Zomato dataset, which includes details about restaurants. Initial exploration involves displaying a snapshot of the dataset and checking data types, confirming that the dataset is well-structured and free of missing values.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: There might be sections focusing on cleaning the data, handling anomalies, and converting data types if necessary, though these are not fully revealed in the examined cells.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project likely continues with exploratory data analysis (EDA), examining the distributions of features such as restaurant ratings and online order availability. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to explore relationships between variables, such as the impact of online ordering on ratings or customer votes.
4) Conclusions and Insights: Finally, the project would summarize key insights derived from the analysis, potentially offering recommendations or business implications based on the findings.
